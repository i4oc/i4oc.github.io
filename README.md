# Initiative for Open Citations (I4OC) website material

This GitHub repository contains all the material used for the website of the Initiative for Open Citations (I4OC) available at https://i4oc.org.

## How to be involved

Starting from 3rd June 2022 all the members of Crossref cannot limit the distribution of their references. All the members that previously had limited or closed references have now been set to open. This means that all the currently deposited references in Crossref are now treated as open metadata.  

A publisher, that is a participant in the Crossref Cited-by service, will be listed in those participating to I4OC if it has at least one deposited article with references.  

You can read the dedicated blog post explaining the new membership terms of Crossref at https://www.crossref.org/blog/amendments-to-membership-terms-to-open-reference-distribution-and-include-uk-jurisdiction/
