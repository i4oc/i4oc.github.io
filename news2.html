                            			<div class="contentFace" style="margin-top:1em">
							<p>Dear I4OC Stakeholders,</p>
							<p>It’s now four months since we publicly announced the Initiative for Open Citations (I4OC). Since the beginning of this effort, <a href="https://i4oc.org/#progress">almost half of indexed scholarly citation data</a> have become freely accessible. We've also had some <a href="https://i4oc.org/press.html">amazing initial press coverage</a> and we continue to add <a href="https://i4oc.org/press.html#July2017">new publishers and stakeholders</a>.</p>
							<p>Data unlocked by I4OC is already being used by a growing number of projects and platforms. <a href="http://opencitations.net">OpenCitations</a> imports citation data into a <a href="http://opencitations.net/corpus">corpus</a> which now includes 8.7 million citation links, a nearly 200% increase since the beginning of the year. Collaborative databases, such as Wikidata, are already using this data to <a href="http://tools.wmflabs.org/sqid/#/view?id=P2860&lang=en">connect and structure knowledge</a> and to generate <a href="https://tools.wmflabs.org/scholia/work/Q25938983">citation graphs</a>. These examples provide just an early indication of the potential of open citation data and we would be delighted to hear about other efforts.</p>
							<p>I4OC’s progress so far has been achieved thanks to helpful conversations with many of the larger publishers, and the majority have already decided to make their references freely available. But there are literally hundreds more publishers who are not currently making their reference data available even though this data is deposited with Crossref. We suspect this is largely because these organisations don’t realise that citation data is closed by default.</p>
							<p><strong>We therefore need your help</strong> to engage that long tail of organisations that the small group who established I4OC can’t contact ourselves. This means any publisher or learned society that is currently not <a href="https://i4oc.org/#publishers">listed as participating in I4OC</a>. We feel that these discussions will be much more constructive and persuasive on a person-to-person level and in this way you can help us get closer to 100% open availability of citation data.</p>
							<p>To help with your discussions, here are the some of the key points that we’ve used in communications with publishers:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>
								It’s really easy to make citation data public.  Hundreds of publishers are already depositing this data to Crossref, but the data is closed by default.  All that needs to be done to make the data public is to send a note to <a href="mailto:support@crossref.org">support@crossref.org</a>. Crossref will implement the change in a day or two. Job done.
								</li>
								<li>
								Making the data more open is in the publisher's interests. With a more open dataset, there are a wealth of benefits that arise, including the establishment of a global public web of linked scholarly citation data to enhance the discoverability and use of their published content, both subscription access and open access.
								</li>
								<li>
								We already know that services such as the Web of Science and Scopus use publisher citation data to provide valuable ways to discover content and the links between content. Fully open citation data will allow the creation of new services that link to the publisher, for the benefit of publishers, researchers, funding agencies, academic institutions and the general public.  Open data will also be valuable for existing services. 
								</li>
								<li>More generally, given the fundamental importance of citation data, questions relating to the evolution of knowledge, ideas and scholarly disciplines will be open to exploration by a much broader community of interested stakeholders.
								</li>
							</ol>
							<p>If you find any other approaches useful, please share them with us, as well as any questions or concerns raised by publishers. As new publishers release their reference data, they will be added to the list of <a href="https://i4oc.org/#publishers">participating publishers</a>, so please keep an eye on the list too!</p>
							<p>Thank you for your help, and your support.</p>

                            		<h1>Availability of open reference data nears 50% as major societies and influential publishers endorse the Initiative for Open Citations</h1>
                            			<div class="contentFace" style="margin-top:1em">
						<p>(San Francisco, California) July 11, 2017 - In the days immediately following the <a href="#April2017">launch</a> of the Initiative for Open Citations (I4OC) in April this year, some major names in scholarly publishing made the decision to release their reference data into the public domain. Three months on, a further 16 publishers have added their names to the list and the <a href="https://i4oc.org/#progress">percentage of articles with open reference data</a> has moved from 40% to over 45%. That’s more than 16 million articles with open references.</p>
						<p>Among the 20 publishers who contribute the largest amount of citation data, those who are making their citation data freely available, now include: <a target="_blank" href="https://publishing.aip.org/">AIP Publishing</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.aiaa.org/">American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.aps.org/">American Physical Society</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.degruyter.com/">De Gruyter</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.emeraldinsight.com/">Emerald</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scielo.org/">SciELO</a>. They join Wiley, SAGE, Springer Nature, Taylor & Francis and <a href="https://i4oc.org/#publishers">many others</a> who made their reference data available prior to, or as part of, the launch of I4OC. Out of the 20 largest contributors, 13 publishers have now moved their reference data into the public domain, and discussions are ongoing with several other publishers.</p>
						<p>Outside of the top largest contributors, many more scientific publishing organisations are also supporting I4OC, notably the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.aaas.org/">American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)</a> – publishers of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sciencemag.org/"><em>Science magazine</em></a> and others, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pnas.org/"><em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> (PNAS)</a>, and three further society publishers: the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ascb.org/">American Society for Cell Biology</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.asbmb.org/">American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.electrochem.org/">Electrochemical Society</a>. They follow the lead already shown, for example, by the American Geophysical Union, the Association for Computing Machinery, and the Royal Society. Other publishers who have moved to release reference data since the launch of I4OC are <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aosis.co.za/">AOSIS</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.intechopen.com/">InTechOpen</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.iospress.nl/">IOS Press</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mdpi.com/">MDPI</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.worldscientific.com/">World Scientific Publishing</a>.</p>
						<p>We are also thrilled to announce that more organizations are joining our list of <a href="https://i4oc.org/#stakeholders">stakeholders</a> endorsing the initiative, including the <a target="_blank" href="http://allenai.org/">Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="https://libereurope.eu/"> Association of European Research Libraries (LIBER)</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cwts.nl/">Centre for Science and Technology Studies at Leiden University (CWTS)</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://core.ac.uk/">CORE</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/">Jisc</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="https://oaspa.org/">Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association (OASPA)</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.scienceopen.com/">ScienceOpen</a>.</p>
						<p><strong>With over 40 publishers now leading the way, we call on all 900+ remaining publishers, particularly the smaller publishers who deposit reference data at Crossref, to join this initiative and make their reference data open.</strong></p>
						<p>Making the data publicly available is <a href="https://i4oc.org/#faqs">simple</a>. To release your reference data, please send a request to <a href="mailto:support@crossref.org">support@crossref.org</a>.</p>
						<p>We’ll report back in three months with an update on how many additional publishers have switched their reference data to open.</p>
